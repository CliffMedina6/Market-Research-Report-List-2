<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water-jet Stone Cutting Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Abrasive Water-jet</li><li>Pure Water-jet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The water-jet stone cutting machine market consists of two main types: abrasive water-jet and pure water-jet. Abrasive water-jet machines use a mixture of high-pressure water and abrasive particles to cut through stone materials. This type is ideal for harder and denser stones. On the other hand, pure water-jet machines solely rely on high-pressure water to cut softer stones. These machines are commonly utilized for materials that may be affected by abrasive particles or those that don't require the additional cutting force provided by abrasives.</p></p>
