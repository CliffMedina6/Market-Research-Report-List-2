<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Refrigeration Dehumidifiers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normal Type</li><li>Heat Pipe Type</li><li>New Air Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Refrigeration dehumidifiers are utilized to lower the humidity levels in various environments. The normal type operates by drawing moist air over a refrigerated coil, which then condenses the moisture and collects it. Heat pipe type dehumidifiers employ a heat pipe to transfer the moisture from the air to a cooler section, where it condenses and is collected. On the other hand, new air type dehumidifiers use a specially designed membrane to separate moisture from the air stream.</p></p>
