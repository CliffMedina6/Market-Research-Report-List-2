<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polypropylene Waxes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normal PP Wax</li><li>Modified PP Wax</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polypropylene waxes have two main types: normal PP wax and modified PP wax. Normal PP wax is derived from crude oil and has a higher molecular weight, making it more rigid and less adhesive. It is commonly used in industries like plastics, coatings, and textiles. On the other hand, modified PP wax undergoes additional processing, enabling it to possess specific characteristics like enhanced compatibility, improved hardness, or increased melt flow. This modified version finds applications in areas such as PVC processing, hot melt adhesives, and ink formulations.</p></p>
