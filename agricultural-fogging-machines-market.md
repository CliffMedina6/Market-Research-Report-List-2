<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Fogging Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal Agricultural Fogging Machines</li><li>Cold Agricultural Fogging Machines</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Agricultural fogging machines are utilized in farming practices to disperse liquid pesticides and fertilizers in the form of fine mist or fog. Two types of these machines are thermal agricultural fogging machines and cold agricultural fogging machines. Thermal fogging machines use heat to create a dense fog that can reach difficult and dense areas, while cold fogging machines utilize a high-pressure system to produce smaller droplets that can effectively penetrate crops. Both types of machines aid in efficient and effective pest control and crop fertilization.</p></p>
