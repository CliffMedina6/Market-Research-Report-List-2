<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil and Gas Industry Gas Compressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Displacement</li><li>Dynamic Displacement</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The oil and gas industry consists of a gas compressor market that can be classified into two main types: positive displacement and dynamic displacement. Positive displacement compressors work by trapping and compressing gas in a chamber and are suitable for handling small volumes at high pressures. On the other hand, dynamic displacement compressors use high-speed rotating components to impart kinetic energy to the gas, resulting in compression. These compressors are more suitable for handling large volumes of gas at lower pressures.</p></p>
