<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Formaldehyde Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Silver-catalytic Oxidation</li><li>Iron-molybdenum Cofactor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The formaldehyde market consists of different types, including the silver-catalytic oxidation and iron-molybdenum cofactor market. In the silver-catalytic oxidation process, formaldehyde is produced by reacting methanol with oxygen in the presence of a silver-based catalyst. This method is widely used due to its high efficiency and low environmental impact. On the other hand, the iron-molybdenum cofactor market involves the production of formaldehyde through the enzymatic conversion of methanol, with iron and molybdenum cofactors playing key roles in the process. This method is known for its ability to operate at low temperatures and high methanol concentrations. Both types contribute to the overall formaldehyde market.</p></p>
