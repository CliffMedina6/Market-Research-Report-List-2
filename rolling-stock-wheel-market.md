<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rolling Stock Wheel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Casting</li><li>Forged</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The rolling stock wheel market can be divided into two major types: casting and forged. In the casting market, wheels are manufactured by pouring molten metal into a mold, resulting in a solid wheel. This method is known for its cost-effectiveness and allows for the production of wheels in large quantities. On the other hand, the forged market involves shaping wheels from a solid piece of metal through heat and pressure. This method creates wheels with enhanced strength and durability, making them suitable for heavy-duty applications. Both casting and forged methods cater to different requirements and preferences in the rolling stock wheel market. </p></p>
