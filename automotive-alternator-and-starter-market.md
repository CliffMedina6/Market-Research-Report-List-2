<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Alternator and Starter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Starter Motor</li><li>Alternator</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Automotive Alternator and Starter market involves two main components: the starter motor and the alternator. A starter motor is responsible for initiating the engine's rotation, enabling it to start. It draws power from the battery to crank the engine, and once the engine is running, it disengages. On the other hand, an alternator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy and charges the battery while the engine is running. Both the starter motor and alternator are crucial for the proper functioning and power supply in automotive vehicles.</p></p>
