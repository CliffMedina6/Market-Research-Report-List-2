<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Concrete Mold Release Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil Based</li><li>Water Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Concrete mold release agents are chemical substances used in the construction industry to prevent concrete from bonding to molds or formworks. There are two main types of release agents: oil-based and water-based. Oil-based agents are typically made from petroleum distillates and provide a high degree of lubrication, making them suitable for complex or intricate molds. Water-based agents, on the other hand, are formulated with water and various additives, which are eco-friendly and offer easy cleanup. Both types serve the purpose of facilitating the release of concrete from molds, but they differ in composition and application.</p></p>
