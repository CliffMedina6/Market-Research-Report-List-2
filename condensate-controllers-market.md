<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Condensate Controllers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electronic</li><li>Mechanical</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Condensate controllers are devices used in industrial applications to manage the accumulation and drainage of condensate in steam systems. There are two main types of condensate controllers: electronic and mechanical. Electronic condensate controllers utilize advanced sensors and control systems to automatically regulate condensate levels and ensure efficient drainage. On the other hand, mechanical condensate controllers rely on mechanical components such as floats and valves to manually control condensate flow. Both types of controllers serve the same purpose but differ in terms of their operation and mechanisms used for condensate management.</p></p>
