<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Vehicle Warning Sound System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Warning Sound System</li><li>Passive Warning Sound System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Electric Vehicle Warning Sound System market consists of two types: Active Warning Sound System and Passive Warning Sound System. The Active Warning Sound System uses artificial sounds to alert people of an approaching electric vehicle, as these vehicles are relatively quiet. It actively emits sound to enhance pedestrian safety. On the other hand, the Passive Warning Sound System uses external sounds generated by the vehicle itself, such as tire noise or wind resistance, to warn pedestrians. Both systems aim to mitigate potential risks and ensure the safety of pedestrians and other road users.</p></p>
