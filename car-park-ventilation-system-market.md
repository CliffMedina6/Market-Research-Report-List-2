<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Car Park Ventilation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Jet Fans</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The car park ventilation system market consists of two main types: axial fans and jet fans. Axial fans are designed to move large volumes of air in a straight line, providing efficient ventilation in a car park. They are typically installed on the walls or ceiling of the parking structure. On the other hand, jet fans are specifically designed to manage air movement in confined spaces, such as underground car parks. They create a column of air that effectively ventilates the area, reducing the build-up of pollutants and improving air quality.</p></p>
