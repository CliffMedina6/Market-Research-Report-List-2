<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crude Steel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully Deoxidized Steel</li><li>Semi Deoxidized Steel</li><li>Not Deoxidized Steel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the crude steel market, there are three types based on the level of deoxidization. Fully deoxidized steel refers to steel that has undergone complete deoxidization during the steelmaking process. Semi-deoxidized steel is partially deoxidized, leaving some oxygen content in the steel. Not deoxidized steel, on the other hand, has not undergone any deoxidization process, resulting in higher oxygen levels. These distinctions are important as the level of deoxidization can impact the steel's properties, such as its strength and corrosion resistance, making it suitable for specific applications.</p></p>
