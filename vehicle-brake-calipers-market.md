<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Brake Calipers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Piston Caliper</li><li>Multi-Piston Caliper</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vehicle brake calipers market consists of two major types: single piston calipers and multi-piston calipers. Single piston caliper systems use one piston to press the brake pads against the rotor, providing the necessary braking force. On the other hand, multi-piston caliper systems employ multiple pistons to distribute the brake force more evenly across the rotor surface, enhancing braking performance and reducing the risk of brake fade. Both types serve the same purpose but differ in the number of pistons used to generate braking force.</p></p>
