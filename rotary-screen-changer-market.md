<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Screen Changer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Piston</li><li>Double Piston</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The rotary screen changer market comprises two main types: single piston and double piston. In single piston screen changers, a single piston is used to alternate between two screens, allowing for continuous operation. This type is often smaller and more cost-effective. On the other hand, double piston screen changers utilize two pistons, each with its own filter screen. This allows for simultaneous filtration and changing of screens, resulting in higher throughput and more efficient operations. However, double piston screen changers are generally larger and more expensive.</p></p>
