<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bus Transmission System (BTS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual TransmissionsysteM</li><li>Automatic Transmission System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Bus Transmission System (BTS) market consists of two main types: Manual Transmission System and Automatic Transmission System. Manual transmission systems require the driver to manually shift gears using a clutch, offering better control but requiring more skill. Automatic transmission systems, on the other hand, use a torque converter to shift gears automatically, providing a smoother driving experience with less effort from the driver. Both systems serve the purpose of transmitting power from the engine to the wheels, but with different levels of driver involvement.</p></p>
