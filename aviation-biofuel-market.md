<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aviation Biofuel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fischer-Tropsch</li><li>Hydrogenated Vegetable</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Aviation biofuel refers to renewable fuel sources used in aircraft engines. Fischer-Tropsch biofuels are produced by converting biomass or waste into synthetic hydrocarbon liquids, which can be blended with conventional jet fuel. This type offers a drop-in solution without the need for engine modifications. Hydrogenated vegetable oils, also known as renewable diesel, are derived from renewable resources like plant oils, animal fats, or used cooking oils. These oils undergo hydrogenation to convert them into a diesel-like substitute. Both types of aviation biofuels contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation industry.</p></p>
