<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Construction Adhesive Tapes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot-Melt Based</li><li>Solvent-Based</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The construction adhesive tapes market consists of various types, including hot-melt based, solvent-based, and others. Hot-melt based tapes are made by heating a solid adhesive until it becomes molten and then applying it to a backing material, which solidifies upon cooling. Solvent-based tapes are made by dissolving the adhesive in a solvent and then coating it onto a backing material, with the solvent evaporating to leave behind a solid adhesive layer. The "others" category includes tapes with different adhesive formulations or application methods, providing a wide range of options for construction needs.</p></p>
