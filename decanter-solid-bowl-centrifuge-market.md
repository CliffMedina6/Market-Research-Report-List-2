<p><strong>The Decanter Solid Bowl Centrifuge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Concurrent Design</li><li>Counter Current Design</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Decanter solid bowl centrifuge is a type of equipment used to separate solids from liquid in various industries. Two common market types for decanter solid bowl centrifuges are concurrent design and counter current design. In concurrent design, the slurry feed and liquid discharge are at the same end of the centrifuge, which allows for continuous operation. On the other hand, counter current design has the slurry feed and liquid discharge at opposite ends, enabling higher efficiency in solids removal. These market types determine the operational flow and separation effectiveness of decanter solid bowl centrifuges.</p></p>
