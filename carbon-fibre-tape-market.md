<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Fibre Tape Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Prepreg Tape</li><li>Dry Tape</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Carbon Fibre Tape market consists of two types: Prepreg Tape and Dry Tape. Prepreg Tape is impregnated with resin and then dried to create a solid state, making it ready to use in manufacturing processes without the need for additional resin application. Dry Tape, on the other hand, does not have resin impregnation and requires an additional resin application during manufacturing. Both types have their respective advantages and are commonly used in industries that require lightweight, high-strength materials like aerospace, automotive, and sports equipment manufacturing.</p></p>
