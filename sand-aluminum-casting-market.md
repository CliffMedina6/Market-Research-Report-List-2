<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sand Aluminum Casting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Green Sand</li><li>Dry Sand</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sand aluminum casting market can be divided into two main types: green sand and dry sand. In the green sand casting process, a mixture of silica sand, clay, water, and additives is used to create a mold for casting aluminum. This mixture is moist and pliable, allowing for easy molding. On the other hand, dry sand casting involves the use of dry sand without any moisture or clay binder. This technique is often used for more complex castings and requires a more precise molding process. Both green sand and dry sand casting have their own advantages and are suitable for different casting requirements in the aluminum industry.</p></p>
