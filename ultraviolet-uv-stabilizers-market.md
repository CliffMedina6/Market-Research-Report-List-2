<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultraviolet  (UV) Stabilizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hindered Amine Light Stabilizer (HALS)</li><li>UV Absorbers</li><li>Quencher</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Ultraviolet (UV) Stabilizers market consists of various types of additives used to protect materials from harmful UV radiation. Hindered Amine Light Stabilizers (HALS) are highly efficient additives that inhibit UV degradation by scavenging free radicals. UV Absorbers absorb UV radiation and convert it into harmless heat, preventing it from penetrating the material. Quenchers also absorb UV radiation but release it as lower-energy light, reducing its harm. Other types include anti-oxidants, flame retardants, and metal deactivators, which provide additional protection and improve durability against UV exposure.</p></p>
